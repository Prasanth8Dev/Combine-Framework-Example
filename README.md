Objective:
The project demonstrates how to implement a login feature using the Combine framework within an MVVM architecture in a UIKit-based iOS application.

Architecture:
Model: The User model contains properties like username and password, and any other necessary data related to the user.

View: The LoginViewController is responsible for the user interface. It contains text fields for username and password input, a login button, and labels to display validation errors.

ViewModel: The LoginViewModel acts as an intermediary between the view and the model. It uses Combine to bind UI components to the model's properties, handle input validation, and manage the login process.

Implementation Details:
ViewModel Binding:

The LoginViewModel uses @Published properties for username and password. These properties are observed by the view to update UI elements in real-time.
Input validation is performed using Combine operators like map and filter, allowing the ViewModel to validate the username and password as the user types.
Networking with Combine:

The ViewModel triggers the login process by calling a function that uses URLSession combined with Combine’s dataTaskPublisher to handle the network request.
The response is processed using map to decode the JSON response, and catch to handle any errors that may occur during the network call.
View Binding:

The LoginViewController subscribes to the ViewModel’s loginState publisher to update the UI based on the current state (e.g., showing loading indicators, displaying error messages, or navigating to the next screen upon successful login).
Error Handling:

The ViewModel handles errors using Combine’s catch and assign operators. It ensures that any errors encountered during login are relayed back to the view, allowing it to display appropriate messages to the user.
Asynchronous Operations:

Combine's sink and assign operators are used for reacting to changes and updating the view accordingly. This approach ensures a clean separation of concerns, with the ViewModel responsible for business logic and the View focused solely on presentation.
Benefits of Using Combine with MVVM:
Declarative Code: Combine allows you to write clear, declarative code for managing asynchronous events.
Reduced Boilerplate: With Combine, you can reduce the amount of boilerplate code required for handling things like KVO, notifications, and delegation.
Better Testability: The MVVM pattern, enhanced by Combine, results in better separation of concerns, making it easier to write unit tests for the ViewModel.
